# pollen-treasure-island

 This project is the Project Gutenberg eBook of Treasure Island recompiled into the language Racket/Pollen.  The content of the book is almost completely unmodified, but I added some improved formatting from open source fonts, and converted the images into transparent PNG files from the original JPG scans.
 
 Purpose
  
  The main goal of this project was simply a personal goal of mine to learn the Racket language, and more specifically in this case, Pollen.  I was strongly inspired by Matthew Butterick's online books, and wanted to create an attractive book using Pollen markup.  It was also an opportunity for me to learn HTML/CSS and practice some basic design skills.  In the process I also found opportunities to learn a number of tools needed to complete this, such as Github, Image Magick, Emacs, TrueType fonts, and a bit of Python scripting.
  
  I chose to use Treasure Island, partly because it was fun, but also because it had some unique challenges incorporating the illustrations, and allowing me to experiment a bit with my own markup tags to structure the pages' visual elements.
  
  Using the application is pretty simple.  It just requires an install of Racket/Pollen and runs as a self-contained locally hosted website.  I also structured it so that the static HTML that it generates can be navigated on its own.
  
  There's a number of improvements I would like to add, so that it can be more portable, and possibly more along the lines of a self-contained statically generated site.  I'd also like to make it easier to read on mobile devices, and allow for some additional style improvements and user selected options.
